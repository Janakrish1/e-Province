Tamil Nadu (e-Province) Certificate Management System

Citizens in every district face the difficulty in issue of government
certificates like birth/death certificate, income and caste certificates, old age
and widow pension, etc. This can be done with e-Province. This project is to
make the government services available to the citizens in a convenient, efficient
and transparent manner, by enabling it simple by reliable access over the internet.
The main objective of this project is to bring the public services closer to the
citizens.
To fulfill the vision of providing an easy and convenient service to the
citizens through remote access primarily through Common Service Centre
(CSCs), e-Province project is created. This project is to develop a State Portal
(SP) to provide all the citizens of the respective province to access the services
under a single interface mechanism in the form of the Portal.
